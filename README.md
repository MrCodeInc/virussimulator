# Virus Simulator
A computer virus simulator.

Soooooooooooooo this is a cool project I am working on that simulates a computer virus.

If you want to try it the link is in the description on the github prpject page.

# Before you try it...

DISABLE POPUP BLOCKER. 
Why? The simulator use popups to look scary.
If the popup happen to fast to stop them get of the launched page and then close all the popups really fast if you can't use CTRL ALT DELETE and find your browsers process and end it.
